Smart coatings with self-healing properties have significant potential to improve the lifespan and 
durability of materials. In this project, a self-healing polymer coating was developed using urea
formaldehyde microcapsules filled with linseed oil as the healing agent. Additionally, graphite-filled 
epoxy composites were fabricated to impart electrical conductivity for real-time crack detection via 
resistance measurement. 
The synthesis of microcapsules was carried out using an in-situ polymerization method. The prepared 
microcapsules were dispersed into a conductive epoxy resin to form the final coating. Crack 
formation was detected through changes in electrical resistance across the coating, enabling early 
identification of damage. 
The study demonstrates the integration of self-healing and crack-sensing capabilities into a polymer 
coating system, offering promising applications in protective coatings for infrastructure, aerospace, 
and automotive industries.
